## AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
Authentication is the process of verifying the proclaimed identity. Usually followed by authorization, which is the approval that you can do this and that. Authentication is the process of verifying your log in username and password. Authorization is the process of verifying that you can access to something.
METHOD OF AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
Most common methods for authentication and authorization include.
1.	Static strings: These are like passwords that are provided by API's to consumers.
2.	Dynamic tokens: These are time based tokens obtained by caller from an authentication service.
3.	User-delegated tokens: These are tokens such as OAuth[2] which are granted based on user authentication.
The above methods provide different level of security and ease of integration. Oftentimes, the easiest method of integration also offers weakest security model.

## 局域网用MAC通讯为什么还要IP?
只是在局域网里，比如我现在一台路由器，或者交换机，连接了几台电脑，做了一个局域网，没有连接外网，为什么还要为每台电脑设置不同的IP，不是局域网用MAC通讯吗？

因为现在网络的通讯都是基于TCP/IP协议的，而TCP/IP协议的规定网络都是分层的，从应用层到物理层各层有各层的功能，如果一个层次没有配置就没法调用下一层的功能。LAN中是采用MAC通信，但是上层协议没法直接调用MAC协议，必须使用ARP协议将IP地址转换为MAC地址才能通信。因此，如果你没有配置网络层的IP地址，就没法调用数据链路层的MAC地址进行通信。除非你自己写一个应用程序直接调用MAC地址，才可以达到不需要配置IP地址的需求。
## Why do we need abstract method in abstract class?

When we want to force child class to provide the implementation of any method.

- 一个等多边形的例子：

任意等多边形可以计算直径，但各个多边形计算面积的方法不一样。你希望所有等多边形要能计算面积和直径。
'''C++
Class Poly ｛
    int num_edges;
    double edge_lenth;
    double calc_diameter(){
        int diameter=0;
        //some calculation here
        return diameter;
    } 
    abstract double calc_area();
｝

Class Square:Ploy{
    double calc_area(){
        return edge_lenth**2;
    }
}

## URL URN URI
A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network "location"). The term "Uniform Resource Name" (URN) has been used historically to refer to both URIs under the "urn" scheme [RFC2141], which are required to remain globally unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes unavailable, and to any other URI with the properties of a name.
